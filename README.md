# Spreadsheet simulation in Haskell, translated from OCaml

![CI](https://github.com/FranklinChen/spreadsheet-haskell/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

This is an attempt at an idiomatic Haskell translation of a highly imperative dataflow system given in ["How to implement a spreadsheet"](https://semantic-domain.blogspot.com/2015/07/how-to-implement-spreadsheet.html).

## Build and run

The Haskell project uses Stack but of course you can just use Cabal.

Run the tests with

```console
$ stack test
```
